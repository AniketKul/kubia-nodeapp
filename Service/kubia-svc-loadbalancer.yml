#If Kubernetes is running in an environment that doesn’t support LoadBalancer services,
#the load balancer will not be provisioned, but the service will
#still behave like a NodePort service.
#That’s because a LoadBalancer service is an extension of a NodePort service.

#You can prevent this additional hop by configuring the service to
#redirect external
#traffic only to pods running on the node that received the connection.
#This is done by setting the externalTrafficPolicy field in the service’s
#spec section.
