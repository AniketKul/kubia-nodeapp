# You might wonder what happens if the referenced ConfigMap doesnâ€™t exist when
# you create the pod. Kubernetes schedules the pod normally and tries to run its
# containers. The container referencing the non-existing ConfigMap will fail to start,
# but the other container will start normally. If you then create the missing ConfigMap,
# the failed container is started without requiring you to recreate the pod
